@file basic_tasks.py
    This file contains a demonstration program that runs some tasks, an
    inter-task shared variable, and a queue. The tasks don't really @b do
    anything; the example just shows how these elements are created and run.

    Rename basic_tasks.py as main.py. Use the example of a
    task function in main.py and what you’ve learned in lecture
    to write a task which runs the closed-loop motor controller
    you have previously written. Hook up a motor from
    your tub and run this task using the cotask.py scheduler
    with its task timing at around 10 ms.
    
    Run the motor task on a motor with a flywheel, printing results and plotting
        step response graphs as you did in the previous exercise. Run the task at a
        slower and slower rate until the controller’s performance
        is noticeably worsened as shown on a step response plot. Record the slowest
        rate at which the performance is not significantly worse than when running
        the controller at a fast rate; this will help you choose a good run rate for
        the motor control task – it should be a bit faster than the slowest rate which
        works for a factor of safety. Save copies of the step response plots for the
        slowest rate at which the response is good and for a rate at which the
        response isn’t as good. Optional: Plot several responses on one set of axes,
        with a legend showing the task run rate of each.

Make two tasks which run two motors under closed-loop control at the same time.
Write a test program which moves your motors simultaneously through different
distances and holds them at the desired positions, and use it to test your code
as thoroughly as possible.
