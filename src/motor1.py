@param[in] reset - boolean value indicating if the motor should be reset or not
This sets four states, 0, 1, 2, and 3. State 0 initializes the motor 1 and encoder ports.
It also hardcodes in the KP and position. State 1 runs the encoder and PWM based on the KP and
positional inputs. This will run for 400ms. State 2 turns off the motor and begins to print data. State 3
is used when data is done being transmitted.
